Okay, before we begin, this first post is for stating why am I doing this, your you to know, but mainly for me to remember.

It has been several years since I've been feeling stuck. If you come from a Computer Science background, when I'll describe my first few years after graduation, you'd think everything is happening in my professional life. With 23 years old, I was the first of my prom to get the title, one week later moved to France to work at INRIA. Coming from a Research-based University (and Family) this was a great first step, and ended up spending there the largest part of 2014. My work was in Computer Vision. Back then, Alexnet and the first Convolutional Neural Networks were gaining ground over traditional Computer Vision + Machine Learning techniques. I did my Final Work (kind of a Thesis for a MSc. title) working on adapting AlexNet for detecting a few scenes in tennis feed from some youtube videos. At that time there was no Tensorflow or Pytorch. All we had was Caffe. In some record time, i managed to get it working on an old NVIDIA Geforce card. Nobody at my Uni believed "Deep Learning" was something that was going to work as a general technique and few people did at INRIA. WIP
